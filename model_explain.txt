#1 define Model in model.py 
    *we are taking images as media urls for db that we need to tell the Pillow where to look for the images*
#2 Now Change the settings for models telling Pillow to look here for the image 
In settings.py  below STATIC_URL & STATIC_ROOT

    MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
    MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')

!!! we were telling instead of actual image in DB there will be the urls of the image !!!

#3 Configure URLS so that it directs what to load or present 
Now, letâ€™s configure our projects urls.py file to reflect/present media files.
urls.py
    from django.conf import settings #(this is basically setting.py)
    from django.conf.urls.static import static

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        #...
        #...
    ] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
#static() will tell what to load InOurCase take MEDIA_URL & MEDIA_ROOT as root  

!!! #3 shows path where image is stored InOurCase (i.e the MEDIA_URL&MEDIA_ROOT)  Load 

#4 Migration  (will write SQL) ADD Data to DB 
cmd : python manage.py makemigrations chai
syntax : python manage.py makemigrations AppName

#5 ADD Details View
?? want to show and list the values of DB  into front-end !!!
telling to take ChaiVariety object from/of DB and transfer into front-end

APP/views.py 
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from .models import ChaiVariety

    def all_chai(request):
    chais = ChaiVariety.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'chai/all_chai.html', {'chai': chais})


    creating a view for perticular chai (onbutton click) for 
    import django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404
    
    def chai_details(request,chai_id):
        chai = get_object_or_404(ChaiVariety,pk=chai_id)
        return render(request,'chai/chai_details.html,{'chai':chai})
